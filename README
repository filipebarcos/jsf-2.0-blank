JSF 2.0 Template Project
========================

This is just a simple Eclipse project used as a starting point
for a JSF 2.0 application.  It was taken from the 
[JSF 2.0 tutorial](http://www.coreservlets.com/JSF-Tutorial/jsf2/#Getting-Started)
from [coreservlets.com](http://www.coreservlets.com).  I'm just
putting it here as an easy way to get to it from anywhere while. Also
having it version controlled allows me to make tweaks when necessary.

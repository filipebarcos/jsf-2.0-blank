JSF 2.0 Template Project
========================

This is just a simple Eclipse project used as a starting point
for a JSF 2.0 application.  It was taken from the 
[JSF 2.0 tutorial](http://www.coreservlets.com/JSF-Tutorial/jsf2/#Getting-Started)
at [coreservlets.com](http://www.coreservlets.com).  I'm just
putting it here for convenient access and for the benefit of
version control which I don't have with the zip file provided.
